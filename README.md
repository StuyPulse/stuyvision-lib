Stuy Vision 2016
================

This is our CV project for FRC 2016: Stronghold.

Forked and made using an alumni's project, inspired by [CUAUV](https://github.com/cuauv)'s auv-vision-gui

## Setting Up

To install OpenCV 3.0, run:

```
$ ./install-opencv-unix.sh 
```

After OpenCV builds, update the Eclipse classpath:

```
$ cp .classpath-generic .classpath     # Generic JRE

OR

$ cp .classpath-osx .classpath         # OSX JRE-1.8 u65
```
